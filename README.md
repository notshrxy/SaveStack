# SaveStack - CONTENT HUB FOR ALL🚀

> **Save it. Sort it. Actually use it.**

SaveStack is a lightweight, privacy-first web app that helps users save important links, notes, and resources in one place — and gently nudges them to come back before their saves disappear.

**I’m building an AI-powered tool that organizes all the educational content students save across apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and LinkedIn.
The tool automatically categorizes posts by domain (like full-stack, UI/UX, game dev), summarizes them, and marks content as “viewed” or “done.”
It solves a real problem: students save hundreds of reels and posts but forget about them within days. 
My tool becomes a smart “content brain” that filters, reminds, sorts, and creates a personalized learning playlist.**

Unlike traditional bookmark managers that become digital graveyards, **SaveStack is built around recall, revisits, and intentional retention**.

## ✨ Core Idea

Most people save things with good intentions… and never return.

SaveStack flips this behavior by:

* Encouraging **periodic revisits**
* Keeping storage **lean and intentional**
* Using **reminders instead of hoarding**

Think of it as a **temporary brain cache** rather than infinite storage.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

```text
User → SaveStack Web App
     → IndexedDB (local saves)
     → Supabase Auth & Profiles
     → Edge Function (email reminders)
     → Email Service → User Inbox
```

---

## 🔄 Reminder System Logic

1. User saves content
2. Save timestamp is recorded
3. Cron triggers Edge Function periodically
4. Inactive users are queried
5. Reminder email is sent (Once every 15/30 days - If found inactive)
6. After 30 days → saves are cleared (Pending)

---

## 🧪 Project Status

* ✅ Core save & recall flow
* ✅ Supabase auth integration
* ✅ Email reminder system
* 🚧 UX polish
* 🚧 Analytics & insights

## 🧭 Future Ideas

* Daily / weekly recap emails
* "Revive or Delete" actions
* Modelling a Browser extension
* Mobile PWA enhancements
